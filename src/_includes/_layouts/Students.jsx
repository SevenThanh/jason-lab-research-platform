                about="I am from Kurdistan, Iran and I joined Stevens for my Ph.D. in fall of 2021. Prior to Stevens, I graduated from the University of Tehran with a master's degree. My past experience includes fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling of axons in a microchannel. For my Ph.D. research, I am focusing on FSI Modeling for High-Speed Parachute Inflations for Mars entry, descent, & landing (EDL). In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and talking about films, biking, and walking."
